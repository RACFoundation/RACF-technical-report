# RAC Foundation Technical Report Format Template

This is a Quarto template that assists you in creating an RAC Foundation technical report.

## Creating a new report

You can use this as a template to create a report.
To do this, use the following command in the terminal window of RStudio (in the project/folder of your choice):

```bash
quarto use template RACFoundation/RACF-technical-report
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your report.

## Installation for existing document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document.
From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command to install this format:

```bash
quarto install extension RACFoundation/RACF-technical-report
```

## Example

[![](examples/template.png)](examples/template.pdf)

## Errors

If you get an error where you get something like "!pdfTeX error: pdflatex.exe (file bchb8a.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for reading ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!", this is caused by an installation issue with TinyTex, resulting in a required font not appearing where it should be. You should run the following command in terminal:

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```
